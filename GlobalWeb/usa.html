        <h2>Team USA</h2>
        <p>
            The U.S has a lot of market value and is perceived to have the highest paying salaries for players. It's only natural because all the organizations have sponsors that reside in the U.S. 
            The Average income for players is roughly $60k-$75k, and that is not including sponsorship from other brands or even earnings from tournaments. The highest paid U.S player had an average salary of $3.5mil, but had the highest earning of $7mil at one point in time making him the richest player in history.
        </p>
        <br><br><h2>USA's Gaming Facility</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike Korea, the U.S doesn't promote E-Sports as a high-status industry for younger kids. It definitely is moving towards that direction, but since the country is too big, it can not support building countless cafe's for kids to play all day.<br>
            Instead professional org's build facilities for their players to stream and practice. One of the biggest facilities is located in Dallas, TX owned by team Envy.
