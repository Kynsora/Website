        <h3>Korean's Income</h3>
        <p>Althought Korea has top performing players, their highest earning player only racked in approximately $1.4mil.
            <br>This seems like a lot of money but when comparing to the income of the highest earner in the U.S, we see that that the difference is huge with the highest income being $3.4mil.
            <br>The difference is by a whole 2 million, the reason behide this is because of popularity and status. The U.S has better market value for the teams and players.<br>Unfortunately even though Korea has most of the talent, they are being seriously undervalued, most try to come to the U.S to make a better income.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="usa">
        <h3>U.S.A's Income</h3>
        <p>
            With $3.4 mil as the highest earning player from the U.S, that does not mean that the U.S necessarily wins the most tournaments. Depending on the game the U.S has a lot of titles, but overall Korea has won the most in the history of E-sports.<br> The U.S has its main income stream coming from Fortnite, while Korea owns the market for League of Legends.<br> The reason for the big difference is due to prize pools for each game. In fornite the prize pool was $5mil at one point, however you have to divide that by 3 or 1 depending on the amount of players. Unlike League of Legends it is a smaller prize pool with more team players up to 5-6.<br>
            that makes the earnings really skewed.
